Advanced Techniques

- Github Repository: saving and sharing iterations of code.
- Pandas: Creating dataframes for each cosmic ray, pickling these and reading them for analysis including printing the dataframe.
- Inheritance: Making use of inheritance classes to give objects further parameters.
- Pytest: Writing test functions to check that functions are doing what they are supposed to.
- 3 Dimensional Figures: Better displays particle trajectories.
- Gaussian Distribution: using gaussian function of the random package to generate a variable weighted interaction probability.
- Relativity: Implementing Lorentz factor to calculate total energy for relativistic particles by making use of relativistic mass.
